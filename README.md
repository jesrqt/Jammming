### About Jammming

Jammming is a React app where users can log into their Spotify account, search music, create a playlist, and save it on their Spotify account.\
The above mentioned features are possible thanks to the connection with Spotify API.\

If you want to see the app in action, here is a deployed app with Netlify: https://tourmaline-crumble-d24e10.netlify.app/

## Motivation of the project

I am currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to become a front-end developer. Through this project, I attempted to learn the following:

* Gain hands-on experience developing a React app from planning, designing, to developing
* Familiarize myself with React JSX syntax
* Learn how to set up states using hooks, especially useState()
* Learn how to pass states using props and use them through components
* Learn to update states based on user inputs through forms
* Learn to read and understand API documentations (Spotify API documentation: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)
* Learn to update states with json objects returned from the API calls
* Learn how to handle API calls, especially GET and POST requests
* Learn to use an API token without exposing it online
* Learn to deploy a website using Netlify

## How does Jammming work?
This app lets users connect to their own Spotify accounts, search songs, and create music playlists.
Here is the video walkthrough of how Jammming works:

Here is the description of how Jammming works: 

1. Search songs by titles, albums, or artists in the input section.
2. If you are not logged into your Spotify account, you will be directed to a Spotify log-in page. Log into Spotify.
3. After logging in, you will be redirected back to the Jammming page. Search songs again.
4. 20 songs will be shown under "Results". If you have songs that you would like to add to your playlist, click on plus icons. The added songs will be displayed in the panel named "My Playlist".
5. Change "My Playlist" to any names of your choice.
6. Click on "Save to Spotify" to save your playlist to your Spotify account.
