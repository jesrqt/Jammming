### About Jammming

Jammming is a React app where users can log into their Spotify account, search music, create a playlist, and save it on their Spotify account.\
The above mentioned features are possible thanks to the connection with Spotify API.\

If you want to see the app in action, here is a deployed app with Netlify: https://tourmaline-crumble-d24e10.netlify.app/
