### About Jammming

Jammming is a React app where users can log into their Spotify account, search music, create a playlist, and save it on their Spotify account.\
The above mentioned features are possible thanks to the connection with Spotify API.\

If you want to see the app in action, here is a deployed app with Netlify: https://tourmaline-crumble-d24e10.netlify.app/

## Motivation of the project

I am currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to become a front-end developer. Through this project, I attempted to learn the following:

* Gain hands-on experience developing a React app from planning, designing, to developing
* Familiarize myself with React JSX syntax
* Learn how to set up states using hooks, especially useState()
* Learn how to pass states using props and use them through components
* Learn to update states based on user inputs through forms
* Learn to read and understand API documentations (Spotify API documentation: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api)
* Learn to update states with json objects returned from the API calls
* Learn how to handle API calls, especially GET and POST requests
* Learn to use an API token without exposing it online
* Learn to deploy a website using Netlify
